# LevelUp SDK Android

The LevelUp Deeplink Auth Library provides an easy way to authorize users via the LevelUp App.

See the documentation and source for [`LevelUpDeepLinkIntegrator`]
(src/main/java/com/scvngr/levelup/deeplinkauth/LevelUpDeepLinkIntegrator.java) for details on how
to authorize users. See the documentation on the [Core Library](../levelUpCoreLib) and
our [developer site](http://developer.thelevelup.com/) for details on what to do once you have an
access token for a user.
